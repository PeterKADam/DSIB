# Learning goals for this exercise

 * Learn how to install and load packages
 * Get a basic introduction to Rstudio (TA)
 * Knit a Rmarkdown document (this document)
 * Look at data from online resources
 * Plot some simple plots

# How to install packages

You should try and install the package "fivethirtyeight" & "tidyverse"

You can do this by running the code:

```{r}
install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

or use the menu "Tools > Install packages"

# How to load packages

When you want to load the packages, you do:

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Knitting

### Q1.1: Try and knit this this document now!

Press the "knit button" or press ctrl+shift+k

IT WILL PROBABLY FAIL! But when you are done installing packages etc. - it should work ;)

## A little more on R markdown

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You insert these chunks of code by pressing ctrl+alt+i or by the >Code>Insert chunk menu 

### Q1.2: Insert a chunk of code that uses the head() function to inspect the cars dataset

Try and knit the document again and see how the html document looks!


---

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```

## Running a chunk of code

Have a look at the "run" menu - upper right corner of this panel.

Note how you run lines, chunks and all code.

Try and run the chunk:

```{r}
head(cars)
plot(pressure)
```

Also try and use the keyboard shortcuts to run the chunk

# Exercise week 1

We will load the data that is built into the fivethirtyeight package.

As an alternative you could find the dataset online, save it and read it from the file.

You can go to https://fivethirtyeight.com/ and download datasets from there.

The link to data: https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/ and find the row with the text "Some People Are Too Superstitious To Have A Baby On Friday The 13th"

You can download a zip file and/or read the story.

## Getting data from https://fivethirtyeight.com/

```{r results=""asis""}
# To see all available datasets in the package
# data(package = "fivethirtyeight")

# To import a specific dataset
# data(US_births_1994_2003)
# help(US_births_1994_2003)
summary(US_births_1994_2003)
```

## Q2.1: Make a scatterplot of births pr. day and color it by day of the week

```{r}
data <- US_births_1994_2003
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = date, y = births, colour = day_of_week)) +
    geom_point()
```
---

You can already answer interesting questions like:

## Q2.2: Is there an increasing or decreasing number of births in the US?
increasing
## Q2.3: Is there an association between day of week and number of births?
yes
## Q2.4: Is there a yearly seasonality in birth numbers?
yes
## Q2.5: Make a boxplot of births pr. day but with day of week on the X axis and use facet_wrap() to make a subplot for each year.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = day_of_week, y = births)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~year)
```

---

## Q2.6: Explain your results. What are the interesting patterns?


---

# Bonus - use chatGPT for learning R

If you look at your scatterplot you see clearly that the datapoints fall into two chunks.

## Bonus Q: Use colors to show what is behind this pattern. Also, investigate if there is a strong difference between Saturdays and Sundays.

Use chatGPT to mutate the date into a factor with levels "weekday", "saturday" and "sunday".


Use chatGPT to make a scatterplot with date on x axis, number of births on y and colored by the factor.

```{r}
data <- US_births_1994_2003

data <- data %>%
    mutate(date = as.factor(date)) %>%
    mutate(date = ifelse(day_of_week == "Sat", "Sat", ifelse(day_of_week == "Sun", "Sun", "Weekday")))

ggplot(data, aes(x = US_births_1994_2003$date, y = births, color = date)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
        title = "Number of Births by Day of Week",
        x = "Day of Week",
        y = "Number of Births"
    )

head(data)
```


	

Discuss the plot and the possible underlying causes.
